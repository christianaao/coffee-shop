    <h3>How We Started</h3>
    <h4 class="sub-heading">A shared passion for coffee and patisserie, nurtured and expanded through voyages across Africa and Europe</h4>
     <p>Our journey began in the rural town of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/LECOM+(Lower+Eastern+Coffee+Mills)/@-1.5249989,37.2529917,1705m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x182f873d66d9c37f:0x128b443a0dd9a488!8m2!3d-1.5236722!4d37.2580022!16s%2Fg%2F11hs3qfzb9?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Machakos, Kenya</a>, where our team's roots stretch deep into the soil of tradition and craftsmanship. United by a shared passion for the alchemy of coffee and the artistry of baked treasures, we honed our skills amidst the lush landscapes and warm embraces of community. We embarked on voyages of discovery across Ethiopia, tracing the ancient paths along the River Nile and traversing the vibrant markets of North West Africa. Each journey expanded our horizons and enriched our understanding of the cultural tapestry woven through every cup and pastry. It was amidst the bustling streets and rich history of Europe that many of us found our final destination, settling in the vibrant enclave of Spinningfields, Manchester. Here, amidst the hustle and bustle of city life, our traditions found new roots, and Ex Espresso was born—a testament to our journey, our passion, and our unwavering commitment to crafting exceptional experiences one sip and one bite at a time.</p>
